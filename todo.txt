checkprocess running:
- checks if a process is running
- I made it for flux, so run this process in the launch script of your pixel editing programs, such as GIMP, etc. 
- for files that just run of a bin (e.g., Inkscape or iMove on Mac) you need to manually create a script that "execs" the main file, but does the check first.
