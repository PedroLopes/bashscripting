Setting up Vim to yank to clipboard on Mac OS X
(From https://www.markcampbell.me/2016/04/12/setting-up-yank-to-clipboard-on-a-mac-with-vim.html)

# Ensuring Vim is capable
If you just want to be able to copy to OS X's clipboard, you just need +clipboard. If you want X11 clipboard support, you need +xterm_clipboard.

``vim --version``

+clipboard
+xterm_clipboard

# Installing Vim via homebrew with the proper options
I use homebrew and I used it to install Vim. If you run brew options vim, you'll see the options available. What we're looking for is --with-client-server:

$ brew options vim
...
--with-client-server
  Enable client/server mode
...

Now, if you just run brew install vim, it'll compile Vim with just +clipboard. If you want X11 clipboard support, you need to install it with the --with-client-server option.

$ brew install vim --with-client-server
...a few lines later...

# Setting Vim to use the clipboard
Add to .vimrc (Note to self, this is what I needed on mac, I actually do not use +xterm_clipboard and it works). 

" yank to clipboard
if has("clipboard")
  set clipboard=unnamed " copy to the system clipboard

  if has("unnamedplus") " X11 support
    set clipboard+=unnamedplus
  endif
endif
